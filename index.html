    <p>A day in the life of a language model.</p>
    <p class="demo" id="ai-text"> Cat goes meow, dog goes bark, cow goes moo, human goes harrrr!
        I got up in the morning and when I went to turn on the coffee machine I tripped over the hose and got a foot of water running through my kitchen floor. 
        It looks like I am getting a cat hole in the floor… Anyway, the problem is that this is going to put the entire floor through its cycle. 
        I am trying to dry out my floor as much as possible and give it a new coat of finish… But I still need to drive all the kids to school. 
        And I just HATE it when they make so much noise at school…</p>
